            [description] => The Office of Environmental Remediation (OER) is responsible for the implementation of the brownfield cleanup and redevelopment initiatives outlined in PlaNYC, the City's comprehensive sustainability plan, to support environmental cleanup and economic redevelopment. In August 2010, Mayor Bloomberg launched the New York City Brownfield Cleanup Program (NYC BCP), the nation's first municipal cleanup program, which offers oversight and liability protection to developers and property owners for sites with light to moderate contamination. OER's Brownfield Incentive Grant (BIG) program provides financial incentives and technical support to developers and community organizations. OER also directs the NYC E-Designation Review Program for Hazardous Materials, Air Quality, and Noise and conducts brownfield educational workshops and outreach activities to support meaningful community engagement in brownfields redevelopment.

MOSPCE also coordinates the activities of the various City agencies and departments with regard to the planning and implementation of special events, and maintains liaison with the private sector for the coordination and support of City-sponsored functions. Gracie Mansion – ""the People's House"" – serves as a historical centerpiece for many of these gatherings, as do New York City schools, museums, theatres, and landmark buildings.

There are 59 community boards throughout the City, and each one consists of up to 50 unsalaried members, half of whom are nominated by their district's City Council members. Board members are selected and appointed by the Borough Presidents from among active, involved people of each community and must reside, work, or have some other significant interest in the community.

            [description] => We're one of the largest public health agencies in the world, serving 8 million New Yorkers from diverse ethnic, cultural and economic backgrounds. After more than 200 years of leadership in the field, we're also one of our nation's oldest public health agencies.

Our work is broad-ranging. You see us in the inspection grades of dining establishments, the licenses that dogs wear, the low- to no-cost health clinics in your neighborhood, and the birth certificates for newborns.

            [description] => The City of New York is a national model for collecting data to measure government performance. Agencies routinely collect data on buildings, streets, infrastructure, businesses, and other entities within the City, including permits, licenses, crime related data, and 311 complaints. MODA centralizes City data, uniting previously disconnected pieces of information from various agencies, and pairs it with NY state, federal, and other open data to create a comprehensive City-wide data platform that serves as a record of City activity, and a foundation for NYC Open Data. DoITT and MODA work closely together to use that platform, DataBridge, to reduce safety risk in the City, deliver daily services more efficiently, and enforce laws more effectively.

            [description] => The Office of Public Advocate for the City of New York is a citywide elected position in New York City, which is first in line to succeed the Mayor. The office serves as a direct link between the electorate and city government, effectively acting as an ombudsman, or ""watchdog,"" for New Yorkers by providing oversight for city agencies, investigating citizens' complaints about city services and making proposals to address perceived shortcomings or failures of those services.

            [description] => The Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity (NYC Opportunity), formerly known as the Center for Economic Opportunity, was established by Mayor Bloomberg on December 18, 2006 to implement innovative ways to reduce poverty in New York City. NYC Opportunity uses evidence and innovation to reduce poverty and increase equity. We advance research, data and design in the City’s program and policy development, service delivery, and budget decisions. NYC Opportunity’s work includes analyzing existing anti-poverty approaches, developing new interventions, facilitating the sharing of data across City agencies, and rigorously assessing the impact of key initiatives.
